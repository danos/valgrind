valgrind for Debian
-------------------

  Debian's valgrind package ships with a suppression file named "debian.supp"
  along with upstream's "default.supp", under /usr/lib/valgrind. Note though
  that by default, valgrind only loads "default.supp".

  You may load "debian.supp" by passing

    --suppressions=/usr/lib/valgrind/debian.supp

  on the command-line (or appending it to ~/.valgrindrc).
